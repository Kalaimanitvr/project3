## 📜 Project Introduction
The computer sales industry thrives on understanding customer preferences and optimizing pricing strategies. This project applies **statistical analysis and hypothesis testing** to analyze computer configurations, assess purchase likelihood, and evaluate pricing strategies.

The dataset contains information about computer specifications such as:
- **Processor speed**, **RAM size**, **screen size**, **CD player availability**, and more.
- Purchase classification (Premium vs. Non-Premium).
- Price distributions and customer purchase patterns.

As a **data analyst**, the goal of this project is to:
- Use statistical techniques to analyze trends and preferences.
- Provide actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing and sales strategies.
- Validate assumptions through hypothesis testing.

## 🎯 Objectives
### Key Goals
1. **Analyze Purchase Likelihood**:
   - Understand customer preferences for features like **RAM size**, **processor speed**, and **screen size**.
   - Calculate probabilities for selling premium computers and specific configurations.

2. **Evaluate Pricing Strategies**:
   - Compare average prices of premium and non-premium computers.
   - Assess the impact of features like **CD players** on pricing.

3. **Statistical Sampling**:
   - Use sampling techniques (Simple Random, Systematic, and Cluster) to understand price distributions.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Test key assumptions about prices and advertising budgets:
     - Is the average price of premium computers significantly different from $2200?
     - Does the mean advertising budget differ significantly between 2022 and 2023?

## 🛠️ Methodology
### Data Analysis Process
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Reviewed distribution of key features like **screen size**, **processor speed**, and **RAM size**.
   - Visualized purchase patterns and probabilities of specific features.

2. **Probability Modeling**:
   - Calculated probabilities for:
     - Selling premium computers with specific features (e.g., CD players, multimedia kits).
     - Joint and conditional probabilities for feature combinations.

3. **Sampling Techniques**:
   - **Simple Random Sampling**:
     - Estimated average price across random samples.
   - **Systematic Sampling**:
     - Selected samples at regular intervals to assess price consistency.
   - **Cluster Sampling**:
     - Grouped computers by price range and analyzed trends within clusters.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Conducted statistical tests to validate business assumptions:
     - T-tests for comparing average prices of premium vs. non-premium computers.
     - Hypothesis testing for differences in advertising budgets over two years.

## 📈 Key Insights and Findings
### 🔍 Purchase Likelihood
- **Preferred Features**:
  - Customers preferred computers with **8GB RAM**, **14-inch screens**, and processor speeds over **33 MHz**.
- **Feature Impact**:
  - The probability of selling a computer increased with the inclusion of features like a **CD player** and a **multimedia kit**.

### 💰 Pricing Insights
- **Premium vs. Non-Premium Computers**:
  - Premium computers have a higher average price but showed no significant price difference from $2200 based on hypothesis testing.
- **Effect of Features**:
  - Computers with CD players had slightly higher average prices, but the difference was not statistically significant.

### 📊 Statistical Sampling
- **Sampling Methods**:
  - Simple Random Sampling provided reliable estimates of average prices.
  - Cluster sampling revealed price variations within specific price ranges.

### 📜 Hypothesis Testing Results
- **Advertising Budget**:
  - There was no significant increase in the mean advertising budget from 2022 to 2023, suggesting a need to reassess marketing expenditures.
- **Price Comparisons**:
  - The average price difference between premium and non-premium computers was statistically significant, validating the premium classification strategy.
